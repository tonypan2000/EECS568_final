# InEKF Localization and Semantic Mapping on the KITTI Dataset

This is our final project git repository for EECS 568: Mobile Robotics: Methods and Algorithms. Our project is InEKF Localization and Semantic Mapping on the KITTI Data Set.

You can see our final presentation video of our program localizing and building a map with KITTI here:

You can find our final report [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/wpzrydmcjzbj).

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* MATLAB

Since our code is written in MATLAB, you can run our program on any OS platform.

### Running Localization Program

First, you need to generate a trajectory with our Left-invariant EKF. To do so, edit line 5 of `Main.m` to feed it the input dataset folder name. For example, for the dataset `0009`, the line of code should look like:

```
filename = '0009';
```

After that, simply run `Main.m` and it will save the poses in SE3 as 12 by 1 vectors in a `.txt` file. The name of the file will be that of the dataset appended by "poses.txt". For instance, the poses generated by the dataset in folder `0009` will be named `0009_poses.txt`.

## Semantic Mapping with LiDAR Points

For test, we are using `gtFine_trainvaltest.zip (241MB) [md5]` as labels, and using `leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip (11GB) [md5]` as raw input images for training.

When validating our training outcome, we are using the images of `val` subfolder of the corresponding datasets.

To test our code, we are now using deducted train, label and val sets.

### Dependencies

* Python 3
* Anaconda
* Cuda, CUDNN
* OpenCV
* CMake
* Eigen
* [Octomap](https://github.com/OctoMap/octomap): version 1.9.5, devel branch

### Usage

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./mapping
```

#### Files in data

* `*.bin`: KITTI LiDAR data.
* `*_pose.txt`: ground truth poses of KITTI odometry sequence.
* `calib_cam_to_cam.txt`, `calib_imu_to_velo.txt`, and `calib_velo_to_cam.txt`: calibration transformation matrix
* `*mapping.ot`: test LiDAR mapping.

`*.ot` files are for visualization with `Octovis`.
