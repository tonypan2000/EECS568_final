# InEKF Localization and Semantic Mapping on theKITTI Data Set

This is our final project git repository for EECS 568: Mobile Robotics: Methods and Algorithms. Our project is InEKF Localization and Semantic Mapping on the KITTI Data Set.

You can see a video of our program localizing and building a map with KITTI here:

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* MATLAB

Since our code is written in MATLAB, you can run our program on any OS platform.

## Running our Program

First, you need to generate a trajectory with our Left-invariant EKF. To do so, edit line 5 of `Main.m` to feed it the input dataset folder name. For example, for the dataset `0009`, the line of code should look like:
```
filename = '0009';
```
After that, simply run `Main.m` and it will save the poses in SE3 as 12 by 1 vectors in a `.txt` file. The name of the file will be that of the dataset appended by "poses.txt". For instance, the poses generated by the dataset in folder `0009` will be named `0009_poses.txt`.

## Dataset Used
